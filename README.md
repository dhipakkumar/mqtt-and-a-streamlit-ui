# mqtt-and-a-streamlit-ui
this application uses the mqtt software and gets random data from the publisher which the subscriber would receive and store it in the data.csv
# running the app
- run the app.py inorder to view the data provided by the publisher
- run the subscriber.py first (so that it could receive the data from the publisher.py)
- then run the publisher.py
- the subscriber would receive the data and store it in data.csv
- the app.py would then use the data.csv file to generate graphs which would be displayed in the window.
